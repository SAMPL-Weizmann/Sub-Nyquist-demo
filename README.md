# Sub-Nyquist-demo

The demo in this repo demonstartes two reconstruction methods created in SAMPL for sub-sampled ultrasound channel data.

Installation:
1) Download the three tar files separately: For each file, click on filename and then on 'Download' (dowloading the entire folder's zip in one go results in distorted files)
2) place the three files in one directory
3) Open the cmd and navigate to that directory
2) Concatenate them to a single tar file using the following command:
"type \*.tar.\* > merged.tar"
(in windows)
3) Extract the .exe file from merged.tar
4) run the .exe file
